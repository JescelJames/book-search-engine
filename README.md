# My Challenge: Modify MERN Book Search Engine App 

## Description
Take starter code with a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and refactor it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API.


### This is a MERN challenge: To help the user generate a simple logo using command line. 

- My motivation:  Understand MERN stack
- Why I took this challege: To convert a RESTful API to GraphQL API
- What the challenge solved:  A simple book search with the ability to save the book in the user's profile.
